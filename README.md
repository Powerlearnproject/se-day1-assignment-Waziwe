Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering
Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the is the process of developing,testing and deploying computer applicactions to solve real world problems by adhering to a set of engineering principles and the best practises.
 The importance of software engineering in the technology industry are: enables innovation,ensures reliability,efficiency and performance,scalability and adaptability and quality assurance.
 
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
mastering machine (1956-1967): hardware dependant,high level languages 
matering process(1968-1982): crisis development 
mastering productivity( 2002- 2010):conceptual level expansion customer productivity customer involvement.
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Software development life cycle involves 6 stages/phases:
1.planning and requirement analysis
planning is a crucial step in everything,just as in software development. in this same stage requirement analysis is also performed by developers of the organisation. This is attained from customer input and sales departments.This is fulfilled by utilizing SRS.
2.Defining requirements
in this stage all the requirements for the target software are specified.These requirements get approval from customers, markets analysts, and stake holders. This is fulfilled by utilizing SRS.
3. Designing architecture
SRS is a reference for software designers to come up with the best architecture for the software.Hence, with the requirement defined in SRS, multiple designs for the product architecture are present in the DDS. The DDS is assesssed by market analysts and stakeholders. After evaluationall the possible factors the most practical and logical design is chosen for development.
4.Developing product
At this stage, the fundamental developmentof the product starts.For this, developers use a specific programming code as per the design in the DDS.
5.Product testing and intergration
After the development of the product,testingof the software is necessaryto ensure its smooth execution. Although, minimal testing is conducted at every stage of SDLC.Therefore at this stage  all the probable flaws are tracked fixed and retested. This ensures that the product confronts the quality requirements of SRS.
6. Deployment and Maintanance of Products
After detailed testing the conclusive product is released in the phases as per the organisations strategy.Then it is tested in a real industrial environment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Agile is flexible and iterative,emphasizing continuous feedback and adaptation.Waterfall is sequential and rigid,with distinct phases completed in order 
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer design, program,build, deploy and maintain software using many different skills and tools.Their job involves meeting with clients to determine the needs for a software solution which will help them design the final product.
Quality assurance engineering: ensures that software functions as intended and meets the specified requirements, evaluates how well the software performance under different conditions and loads, 
project manager: planning and scoping, execution and management,communication and stakeholder management,reporting and documentation.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
efficiency: IDEs streamline the development process,offering tools for coding,testing and debbugging within a unified interface.This reduces the time and effort required for devolopment tasks.
collaborate: VCS enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase concurrently, facilitating collaboration and reducing the risk of code conflict.
code intergrity: VCS tracks changes to codebase providing a historyof modification and enabling developers to revert to previous versions if neccessary.
quality assurance: IDEs often include built-in testing and debugging tools which contribute to the overal quality of software by identifying and resolving issues early in the development process.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
complexity: dealing with complex code, architecture,and system interactions can be challanging
solution: break down complexity, use modular design, clear documentation and code reviews to simplify complex sytems
changing requirements: adapting to evolving project requirements and scope changes
solution: agile approach,embrace agile methodologies to accomodate changing requirements and deliver incremental improvements 
time pressure: meeting deadlines and managing time effectively.
solution: time management,prioritize tasks,set realistic deadlines and use time tracking tools to manage work load effectively.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit: this tests individual components or units of code to ensure they function correctly in isolation. its the first level of testing and helps catch bugs early.
intergration: this verifies how different modules or components of a sytem work together. it ensures that the intergrated system functions as expected.
system: this tests the complete and intergrated software system to evaluate its specifications with the requirements.it validates the systems functionality,perfomance and reliability as a whole before it goes live.
acceptance : this involves end-users or stakeholders testing the software to ensure it meets their requirements and expectations. it validates that the software is ready for release

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is an artificial intelligence engineering technique that refines large language models with specific prompts and recommended outputs.
prompt engineering  is eesential for creating better AI powered services, minimizing biases and getting better results from existing generative AI tools.
prpompt engineeringalso plays a role in identifyingand mitigating various types of prompt injection attacks 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague prompt: write and essay about life
improved prompt: " write 500-1000 words essay on the impact industrial evolution has on the quality of life in the 20th century.
improved prompt is more effective because it provides clear and specific guidelines. it specifies the number of words,the topic and the context.
